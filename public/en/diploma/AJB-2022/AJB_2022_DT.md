Dear Mr Novak,
I am writing to make a complaint about yesterday’s Czech class. I was not happy with it, and 
I think you, as the owner of the language school, should know. The teacher, Ms Novotna, 
spilt coffee on the carpet and on a couple of students. I understand these things happen and 
they do not make me angry. I think Ms Novotna dealt with the situation well when she called 
the receptionist to ask for the cleaning lady. The dirty carpet made the receptionist upset, but 
she arranged everything quickly, which was great. However, it took the cleaning lady ages to 
clean the carpet, and so we lost 30 minutes of the class. It is not only me who the cleaning lady 
made angry, other students and the teacher were upset by her, too. Please let us know what you 
plan to do about our lost time.
Yours sincerely,
Henry Dawson

Coober Pedy
In Australia, there is a town called Coober Pedy where opals – valuable stones – were discovered 
in the 1900s. The opals attracted many people who spent days looking for them. Most of these 
people didn’t even build homes, they just slept in the mines1 to save money on housing. Today, 
about 60% of the inhabitants of Coober Pedy live underground, although not for the same 
reason as the people looking for opals. In the town, where temperatures are very high, people 
simply moved into empty caves to protect themselves against the extreme climate. The problem 
is that these underground homes have no windows so the electricity bill is high as the lights 
must be on most of the time. Without thinking about the environment, people moved 
underground to protect themselves. But protecting the environment above their homes might 
become an issue soon. Nowadays, the main issue is crowds of tourists coming to the town. 
The tourists are attracted by the underground homes and want to see them.

Olivia, a 7-year-old Australian girl, took her toy monkey Sophie on her family trip to the UK. But 
on her way home, she realised Sophie was missing. Olivia returned to Australia without her toy 
monkey. When she was telling the story to her class, she suddenly remembered that she had 
left Sophie in Buckingham Palace, home to the Queen. So Olivia’s teacher encouraged her and 
the other children to write a letter to the Queen to ask if the toy had been found. The children 
also helped Olivia draw pictures of Sophie. Then they put them inside an envelope along 
with the letter, and sent it to Buckingham Palace. What they absolutely didn’t expect was that 
the Queen would reply. When Olivia’s class received a box from Buckingham Palace weeks 
later, the children were excited. They found Sophie inside and one more toy animal – a corgi, 
the Queen’s favourite type of dog.

The World’s Ugliest Dog Contest
This contest is an annual event held in the city of Petaluma, California. It has been going on since 
the 1970s, with different first place prizes at different times. It started with a cheque for $1,000. 
Later, the organisers added a dog bowl worth $500. However, after a few years, dog owners 
protested against the bowl. They suggested that dog food would be a more useful prize because 
it was expensive – up to $1,000 a year. But because each dog eats different food, the suggestion 
was refused and the bowl has continued to be one of the first place prizes. Three years ago, 
the organisers raised the amount of the cheque by $500, and added a travel voucher. Since then 
the winner could spend a seven-day holiday in the country’s capital without paying for transport 
and accommodation. Besides the cheque, the voucher has been very popular with the winners.

Do You Remember Paul Hunt?
In December 2020, news came out that Paul Hunt had ended his career in gymnastics and 
retired due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If you don’t remember him, he was a male gymnast. In 
1972, he became the U.S. National Floor Exercise1 champion, which was his highest title. But 
while other, better gymnasts became famous in the 70s and 80s by becoming Olympic winners, 
Paul Hunt became famous for his performances during women’s gymnastics competitions. He 
started coaching women’s gymnastics in 1974. While showing a gymnast how to do something, 
he realized how funny a man performing women’s gymnastics might be. Paul Hunt showed his 
gymnastics skills during the breaks in women’s gymnastics competitions just for fun, he even 
wore women’s sports clothes. He wanted to make his female gymnasts laugh, and they loved 
him for it. Some former Olympic winners wished Paul Hunt had been at the Olympic Games and 
performed as a female gymnast. They thought it would have been fun.

Grand Canyon River Trips with the Colorado River Company (CRC)
A river trip through the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River is one of the best trips you will ever 
take in your life. The CRC has twenty years of experience with such trips. Most of their clients 
travel to the Grand Canyon to go on a river trip. However, hiking is what most visitors to the 
Grand Canyon go to do there. The CRC hopes that one day river trips will become more popular 
than hiking.
BASIC INFORMATION
SAFETY FIRST – It is very important for the CRC that its clients are safe during their river trips. 
That’s why each client receives an e-mail a week before they arrive there. It contains information 
about what to do and what not to do in the Grand Canyon. Starting on the 1st day of the trip, clients 
must behave according to these instructions as there will be no time for an instructional meeting.
EQUIPMENT – Before clients set off, the CRC staff will check that everybody has the necessary 
camping equipment. For example, if clients are missing a tent, the CRC offers to take them to 
a rental shop to rent it. Please note that the company does not provide clients with its own 
camping equipment due to risk of damage. 
While on the river, it is necessary to wear a life jacket. They are provided for free by the CRC 
unless a client is a size bigger than XXL, in which case the client needs to bring his/her own. 
AGE LIMITS – How old adult clients are is not important. However, no children under 14 years of 
age are allowed to take part in any Grand Canyon river trips with the CRC. Children aged 14 or 
older are welcome!
KAYAK TRIP
The length of a kayak trip is about 12 days. The CRC reserves the right to change the length 
of the trip due to bad weather conditions. Clients do not need to worry about cooking as all 
the meals along the way will be made by the CRC staff. Some minimum requirements: clients 
should be healthy and strong enough to paddle their kayaks all day and to carry them to and 
from the camps where they will sleep. Small wooden cottages are available in the camps to 
keep equipment in overnight while clients spend the night in their tents. 
PRICES/DISCOUNTS: $3,285 per 2-person kayak. 10% off if a client books three or more kayaks 
– perfect for groups of friends.
MOTORISED RAFT TRIP
# 7 days and 6 nights as the CRC travels down the Colorado River, covering its complete length 
in the Grand Canyon. Weather is no limit for this trip, but clients’ fitness is. Clients should 
make sure that their overall health and physical strength are very good. This trip is full of 
experiences on the water, but also full of beautiful hiking trips. Each day’s experiences start 
with a rich breakfast prepared with love by the CRC staff. However, after a hard day it will be up 
to the clients to make their own meals in the camps’ kitchen halls. Apart from these and small 
wooden cottages, there are large areas in the camps for putting up tents. Luckily, clients will 
not have to do that. It is not because the CRC staff will put the tents up for them, but because 
the CRC arranges for clients to stay in the cottages. The CRC has had much better experience 
with such accommodation on this kind of trip than with tents.
PRICES/DISCOUNTS: $1,705 per person, even per individual in a group of friends. If clients 
take their family with them, each member pays only half of $1,705. 
Both trips end with a good-bye party at the camp south of Buffalo Creek Falls, a waterfall where 
clients spend most of their last day relaxing. The party is popular with clients as it gives them time 
to talk about their feelings and experiences with the others. Most of them talk about the day at 
Buffalo Creek Falls. Sometimes they wish the good-bye party was taking place at the waterfall. 
One day, when it is allowed, CRC will definitely hold the last day event at Buffalo Creek Falls.

…
Steve Feltham is a 59-year-old Nessie hunter from South West England who has lived on 
the shores of Loch Ness since 1991. 
Steve first heard about Nessie when he was seven. One Sunday, his parents decided to go on 
a family trip to Loch Ness, a famous lake in Scotland, the following weekend. Steve couldn’t 
wait to go there and he kept telling his classmates about it all week. They told him that 
a monster called Nessie lived in the lake. But Steve knew that because his dad had already 
told him when he and Steve’s mum decided to take the trip to Loch Ness. Steve immediately 
became interested in Nessie. On the way to Scotland, Steve’s dad kept telling him stories about 
Nessie to pass the time in the car. In fact, Steve’s mum had already started this the night before 
the departure when she told Steve a bedtime story about Nessie. When the family got to Loch 
Ness, they first visited Urquhart Castle with a guide. It was Steve’s first time hearing that there 
were Nessie hunters living on the shore. He started dreaming of becoming a Nessie hunter 
himself one day.
However, it took Steve years to become a Nessie hunter. One evening in 1990, after a long 
day at work, he suddenly remembered the trip to Loch Ness and how much he wanted to 
film Nessie. So the following year, he quit his boring office job, ended his relationship with 
his girlfriend and decided to move to Scotland. As soon as he managed to sell his house, he 
bought an old van and left for Loch Ness. The first thing he did there was ask professional 
studios if he could borrow a video camera. One studio liked his plan to film Nessie and decided 
to lend him one of their old video cameras. Steve finally became a Nessie hunter.
To make money while waiting for Nessie, Steve started drawing pictures of the creature and 
hoped they would make him well-known and bring him money. He also started creating 
models of Nessie. However, nobody was buying anything from him. One day, Steve appeared 
on a BBC TV programme, which was seen by many people. They soon started arriving at Loch 
Ness and wanted to meet Steve. He offered them his models of Nessie and they sold out 
quickly. People wouldn’t buy them from an unknown person but when the BBC made Steve 
famous, everybody wanted a model of Nessie. This programme also made journalists visit him. 
‘I’ve no idea how many magazine interviews I’ve given,’ Steve says. ‘And in the end, they took 
photos of me, my drawings and models of Nessie, and didn’t forget to buy one of them from 
the famous Nessie hunter,’ he smiles.
Journalists still come from time to time and Steve answers all their questions but in the end, 
they always ask: Is there a Loch Ness monster or not? Answering such questions doesn’t bother 
him, but he wishes he also had a chance to explain why he chose to live the life he lives. But 
they never ask him questions about that and it makes him angry sometimes. Instead, they’re 
more interested in his love life and money, which makes Steve laugh. ‘I’m single and poor. 
It might be annoying to somebody to answer such questions again and again, not to me, 
though. I’m just glad they rarely ask me about my future because I don’t want to think about it. 
My life is here and now,’ says Steve, ‘and I wouldn’t change anything’.

A Polar Bear or a Grizzly Bear?
Everybody knows what a polar bear or a grizzly bear looks like. But (50) _________ you heard 
of a pizzly? What is that, you ask? A pizzly is a strange-looking bear which was caught by 
people (51) _________ the first time in 2006. It all happened in the Northwest Territories of 
the Canadian Arctic. This bear (52) _________ by scientists as a kind of bear that combines1

# 2006 and I am almost sure that it was a pizzly he shot. I got this feeling after (57) _________ 
the bear’s white and brown fur and the small hill on the bear’s back,’ remembers Roger.
‘The bear actually was a hybrid,’ confirmed Judy McLinton, one of the officials from 
the Northwest Territories. She added, ‘Jim Martell, an American hunter, shot the animal in 2006. 
He paid $58,400 (58) _________ hunt polar bears in our region.’ 
And Mr Martell, the hunter, told *The National Post*, ‘Everybody thought that the animal was 
a polar bear but then they (59) _________ it more closely. That’s when they discovered 
(60) _________ signs that showed the creature might be a grizzly bear. The bear had white fur, 
typical of polar bears, but the shape of its back and face were typical of a grizzly bear.’
Nowadays, it is easy to recognize a pizzly because (61) _________ the differences are known.
