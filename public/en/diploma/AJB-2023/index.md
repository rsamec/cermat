> **The Comcast Building**
> 
> 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City
> 
> **BASIC INFO** -> The Comcast Building is a skyscraper, which has 66 floors and it is best known 
> as the home of the NBC television network, and for the Rainbow Room. It is the 28th tallest 
> building in New York City and the 60th tallest in the United States. It is 400 feet shorter than 
> the Empire State Building which lies south of the Comcast Building.
> 
> **OWNERS** -> The construction of the building started in 1932 when businessman 
> John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his family’s company finally found the land to build it on. When 
> it was finished, its owners – the Rockefeller family company – rented some space to NBC, 
> an entertainment company. In 2000, after almost seventy years of owning the skyscraper, 
> the Rockefellers sold the building to Tishman Speyer Properties, a real estate company, 
> which has owned it ever since. The Comcast Building is one of the most desired locations for 
> companies looking for office space in New York City’s most prestigious business district. British 
> company Deloitte, for example, moved into the skyscraper recently.
> 
> The owner has the whole building checked regularly. The last time was in 2019, five years after 
> the last total repair of the building, which was carried out in 2014.
> 
> **MOST FAMOUS PLACES IN THE COMCAST BUILDING**
> 
> **THE ROOF**
> 
> This is a place from which visitors have an amazing view of the city. Visitors can only use one 
> lift to get there. It starts on the ground floor and goes directly to the roof. The other 59 lifts 
> in the building are only used to get to the other floors. On a clear day, visitors can even see 
> planes approaching and leaving John F. Kennedy International Airport. If the roof was a few 
> feet higher, the airport itself could be seen as well. In 1960, a 400-pound weather radar 
> was installed on the very top of the Comcast Building. It was used for weather forecasts for 
> thirty-five years. Although it is now out of service, it remains in its original location due to its 
> historic value.
> 
> **THE RAINBOW ROOM**
> 
> This is a restaurant on the top floor of the 66-floor building. It is listed among the most popular 
> places for weddings in New York City. On weekdays, it opens at 4:30 pm and closes at midnight. 
> During opening hours, the Rainbow Room serves dinner to more than a thousand visitors 
> every day. However, there were four times when the famous restaurant could not do that, 
> either due to renovation or financial difficulties. The last time this happened was ten years ago. 
> Let’s hope it doesn’t have to close again soon.
> 
> **NBC STUDIOS**
> 
> These are TV studios where many top talk shows are filmed. Many viewers think that 
> the studios are on the top floors of the 66-floor building. That is because a large picture of 
> the view from the top of the building is often used as a background for the shows. However, 
> the studios fill the building’s first fourteen floors. The studios are open to the public from 
> 8:20 am to 2:20 pm on weekdays. The number of tickets per hour is limited to 150 so that 
> the total number of visitors a day is less than one thousand. Tours of the studios actually began 
> as early as 1933, soon after the studios started working. The NBC studios have always been 
> open to the public except for one year in which tours weren’t possible. However, the studios 
> have never stopped working for a single day in its 90-year history.
> 
> In 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit New York City and damaged a lot of buildings. The NBC studios 
> staff reported on the hurricane. They did so despite the danger of being in the Comcast 
> Building at that time. The skyscraper itself remained whole and all right although it was 
> expected to be damaged by strong winds.

> **Fan of the 1810s Only Wears Historical Clothes**
> 
> Zack Pinsent, a 25-year-old man from Brighton, has chosen to reject modern fast fashion and 
> only wear 1810s-style clothing. The 1810s was a period of ten years known as the Regency 
> era so Zack is sometimes called a Regency-era gentleman. Zack burned his last pair of jeans in 
> a symbolic fire when he was 14, and he has been dressing as a Regency-era gentleman ever 
> since. What’s more, he has been designing clothes for other fans of history since he was 19. 
> After 11 years of wearing 1810s-style clothing Zack is confident and says that wearing these 
> clothes is the only way he can express himself in the 21st century.
> 
> Naturally, people look at Zack Pinsent in his 1810s-style clothing everywhere he goes. They 
> often ask him whether he loves history or whether he is a history professor. They think that 
> is the reason why Zack dresses as a Regency-era gentleman. Zack says, ‘The attention feels 
> good although sometimes I become tired of answering people’s questions. The reason for 
> my initial choice to put on historical clothes had nothing to do with a love of history. It was 
> quite a simple one. My family and I found a box full of my great-grandfather’s old suits from 
> the Regency era after we had moved house. I found that the suits fit me well, so I started 
> wearing them. I was surprised how comfortable I felt in them, I hadn’t expected that. In 
> the end, I wore nothing else. Wearing historical clothing is one of my greatest pleasures today. 
> I can’t imagine feeling comfortable in modern clothes.’
> 
> Zack remembers a surprising moment from his school days, when he was voted 
> the best-dressed person of the year. He won despite never wearing modern clothes to school 
> like everybody else. However, there was one day when people could see Zack in jeans and 
> a leather jacket. This was at a great 1950s-themed party at his classmate’s house. Zack bought 
> the clothes especially for the occasion. He went shopping for the set of clothes with his best 
> friend, who promised to buy it from Zack after the party. Interestingly, Zack saw his best 
> friend a week ago. Zack was walking in a park in his usual clothes when he saw his best friend 
> wearing the same outfit they had bought together. The jeans and the jacket remain the last 
> pieces of modern clothing that Zack has worn.
> 
> As a child, Zack didn’t care about fashion and his mother chose or made all his clothes. When 
> he began wearing 1810s-style clothing, he was lucky to have an uncle who knew a lot about 
> history and historical clothes. He became Zack’s advisor. After wearing out his first suits, Zack 
> now designs and hand-sews all his sets of clothes himself. Sometimes it takes him ten months 
> to make them perfect. Zack believes that his designs fit even better than those made by 
> a professional tailor.
> 
> And how do people usually react to Zack? He says, ‘I got used to the looks I receive, and I know 
> that people aren’t studying me to make me feel embarrassed. At first, I was worried that people 
> would be rude or upset by what I wear in public places. To my surprise, this has never been 
> the case. Everywhere I go, people are keen on knowing more about my clothes. But I must say 
> that I still feel a little nervous when a huge group of football fans walk towards me. My natural 
> reaction is to look down in a shy manner to prevent aggressive behaviour. However, football 
> fans have always been kind and asked me questions about the clothes.’
