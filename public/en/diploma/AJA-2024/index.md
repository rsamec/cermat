# 25 Where does Hawaiian pizza come from?

> **The Hawaiian Pizza**
> 
> Pineapple on pizza? Where does it even come from? Pizza originates in Italy and Italians are proud 
> of their pizza. But the Hawaiian pizza, topped with ham and pineapple, has nothing to do with 
> Italy. It was a Greek immigrant called Sam Panopoulos who invented it and first introduced it to 
> the menu of his restaurant. It was in 1962, three years after Hawaii became the 50th state of the 
> USA. People loved everything Hawaiian. So, when they started to import Hawaiian pineapple into 
> North America, Panopoulos had the idea of putting it on a pizza and calling it the Hawaiian pizza. 
> He immediately brought this idea to life in his restaurant in the province of Ontario, Canada. His 
> guests loved it or hated it from the beginning. Recently a survey has found that 82% of people like

> opened to the public. Since then, people have been bringing their unwanted books to leave them 
> there for somebody else. The library now has over 25,000 books, which is more than some schools in 
> the area can lend to their readers. Following the success of the library, the garbage collectors want to

# 27 Why does Paul Barton upload videos onto his YouTube channel?

> **YouTuber Paul Barton**

> taught them to react to music like that,’ smiles Barton. Either way, his playing attracts the animals’ 
> attention. Barton uploads videos of them on his YouTube channel. Most viewers understand that 
> Barton doesn’t mean to collect money through his videos. They send it anyway for Barton to have 
> some money for himself. But he keeps none of it. Viewers also send the links to his videos to others.
