The Tiger which Asked for Help
One day, a tiger appeared at Ivan Pavlov’s house in Solontsovyy, a Russian village. ‘It looked 
very weak and I thought it had been hurt, maybe a car hit it as you don’t expect to see 
a tiger so close to the village. I called emergency services,’ says Pavlov. They arrived quickly 
and moved the tiger to a veterinary clinic. At first they thought the tiger had been hurt by 
hunters, but when they looked closer at its body, they found no injuries. There were no 
broken bones, either, which meant that Pavlov was wrong. But when vets opened the tiger’s 
mouth, they were surprised: its upper teeth had fallen out. The vets believe the animal came 
to people for help because without teeth it could no longer hunt. Now they have to decide 
if they should move the tiger to a zoo. They are worried other tigers might hurt it or even 
worse – kill it, which isn’t unusual behaviour.

The First Telephone Calls
When the telephone was introduced to the American public in the late 19th century, inventor 
Alexander Graham Bell started thinking about the proper way to answer the phone. Bell 
liked the word ‘Hey’ but his friends said it was too rude for answering the phone, so Bell 
changed his mind. Instead he suggested ‘Ahoy’, which was used to greet ships. Users of 
the first telephones started officially using it to answer the phone but soon they wanted 
to know what to say in return to ‘Ahoy’. Bell said that sailors would reply: ‘Aye’. So users of 
the first telephones followed Bell’s suggestions; but not for long. Bell’s friend, Thomas Edison, 
didn’t like either of Bell’s suggestions, he preferred ‘Hello’ because it was easily heard and 
the other person could say the same. It took callers a year to stop saying ‘Ahoy’ and start 
officially using ‘Hello’. Although there are no strict rules, ‘Hello’ is still widely used today to 
answer the phone.

M-PROFI is a company in Moscow which offers a special course that has become very 
popular recently. It’s suitable for all people who like to use selfie sticks when taking pictures 
on their sightseeing trips. The stick helps people get a better photo, but it also gives signals 
to thieves that these people are tourists and that there might be something expensive to 
steal from them. The course teaches selfie stick defence techniques. The difference between 
selfie sticks and guns is that selfie sticks are legal and can be carried on planes. It is often 
the only thing that tourists have to defend themselves. Organisers offer advice on which 
sticks are the best, suggesting that those made of solid metal are the most effective.

Determined1 Young Man
When 22-year old Timothy Abbott got a university degree he thought finding a job would 
be easy. However, after applying for almost 300 jobs via e-mail, only a few companies replied 
and asked him to come to a job interview. So he decided to change his strategy. He printed 
# 300 copies of his CV and went to the busiest London underground station where he stood 
with a sign saying ‘Degree in marketing – Ask for a CV’. That same day a manager from 
a marketing company saw him and asked him to come to a job interview with her. He did, 
was hired by her that day and has been working there since. ‘It took only 2 hours to get a job 
this way!’ laughs Timothy. ‘And about 30 people had asked me for my CV by the time she saw 
me.’ Timothy hopes that other young people find a job, too. ‘Do whatever helps! Don’t sit at 
home and wait,’ he encourages others.

International Yoga Day 2018
On the first day of summer in 2018, millions of yoga fans practised yoga together to celebrate 
*International Yoga Day*. Although yoga started in India, it is now practised almost everywhere. 
For example, hundreds of people practised yoga under the Eiffel Tower and other places 
across France to celebrate this day. However, the largest yoga session in Paris that day was 
held in one of the largest parks in Paris. Similar events took place all around the world that 
day, too. In San Francisco, more than five thousand participants performed 108 rounds of 
Sun Salutations. Twenty times more people than that met for a yoga session in one place in 
the city of Kota, India. The participants were officially counted to see if the number would be 
larger than the one in the Guinness Book of World Records. And it was! The previous record 
was set by 35,985 people from New Delhi, India. They held it for three years.

MELISSA AND BURTON LITTELL’S FARM, NEW ZEALAND – SUMMER 2022
We are looking for people to help us with our fields of fruit and vegetables as well as to look 
after farm animals this summer. We have had volunteers1 on our farm for 15 out of the 20 years 
we’ve owned it. The first five years after we bought it were hard without volunteers, so having 
them here every year has been great. The number is different every summer. One year we 
had as many as 16 people helping us, another year just ten. This is the smallest number of 
volunteers we must have here to help us. However, the ideal number for us is 15. Be one of 
them this summer!
YOU SHOULD:
– be 18-26 years old.
– be able to communicate in English*.
– be fit, friendly, willing to work hard.
*  *Most volunteers are usually at B1 level or higher in English, and they bring their certificate with* 
*them. However, we don’t care about your language level; we care about your help with our farm.*
YOU SHOULDN’T:
–  smoke on the farm in a place where it’s not allowed. If we find you smoking outside the area 
that we have selected on the farm for this purpose, you’ll be sent home. 
– use drugs and/or drink large amounts of alcohol while staying with us.
– be aggressive towards others.
WE PROVIDE:
–  accommodation and three meals a day. Inside the farmhouse, there are enough beds, a large 
kitchen and a large dining room. We are meat eaters – mostly of our own animals. Although 
we cannot provide special diet meals, we can prepare meals for volunteers who have given 
up eating meat and fish. 
–  free Wi-Fi. The signal is often weak, especially when the weather’s bad. But the weather has 
no effect on the high quality mobile phone signal here, so if you can’t communicate with 
your friends online due to a bad Internet connection, you can call them.
HELPING WITH THE ANIMALS
We have sheep, cows, chickens, and horses. Please note that anyone can help us with 
the animals unless it’s his/her first experience with such work. Work with the animals should 
start early in the morning but no worries, you won’t start working until 6 am. Just make sure 
you’ve had breakfast by then because that’s when you begin your work around the animals. 
It’s necessary to go to the nearby town twice a week to shop for the farm. That’s why it’s also 
necessary for you to have a driving licence.
HELPING IN THE FIELD
We grow all kinds of fruit and vegetables, which need a lot of everyday care. It would be 
great if you had some experience working in the field, but we’re fine if you don’t. Those with 
experience will show you what to do. Your day will begin at 6 o’clock, that’s when breakfast is 
served. Breakfast time lasts half an hour, then you will all go to the field and start working. We 
might ask you once or twice to go shopping for gardening equipment etc. That’s why it will be 
a problem if you don’t have a driving licence. You need to get one before you come.
HORSE RIDING IN FREE TIME
Are you an advanced horse rider? Then join us on our daily evening ride. If you’re not but 
you’d still like to learn how to ride a horse, you can ask our neighbours, the Johnsons. They 
have a horse riding school on their farm, so they offer to teach our volunteers. Please consider 
accepting the offer because we can’t let you ride any of our trained horses if you haven’t 
learned how yet.

Not Speaking for a Week
*blog by Pauline Anthony*
On Friday evening two weeks ago I suddenly felt stressed out. The whole week had been 
very busy: every day I had attended several meetings where there were long discussions with 
my colleagues. I realised that at least 60% of the time we were saying things which weren’t 
important. Thinking about it, I realised that what made me so tired was speaking all day every 
day. Speaking to people that week was so exhausting for me that I made a decision: starting 
Monday I’d be completely silent for seven days. At work I was surprised how much time I saved 
by avoiding chatting with others in the hallway. However, I was afraid my colleagues would 
think I was rude and that they would be angry. But they only thought I was funny and they 
even offered to give me $100 to make me say something. I just smiled and remained silent.
But of course, I had to communicate with people somehow. During my week-long silence I 
didn’t communicate with colleagues and clients via anything other than e-mail. There was one 
colleague who tried to use sign language with me. I was surprised because I didn’t know he 
could do that. I wished I had known how to sign back. When I need to tell my family something, 
I don’t send them text messages, I always call them. But during that week I couldn’t, so I had 
to text them. I did the same with my friends and also with my boyfriend. The difficult part was 
being silent at home. It was strange not talking to my boyfriend over dinner. However, he liked 
the new silent me, and for fun he kept leaving little paper notes on the fridge saying *How are* 
*you?* or *I miss you*. After I’d replied below his questions, he collected the notes as memories.
In the middle of the week I was seeing a close friend, Sarah. She had just split up with her 
boyfriend and felt miserable. I was sure she would show respect for me and wouldn’t make 
me speak. But on my way there, I got nervous that she wouldn’t feel free to say as much as 
she needed because I’d be silent. I was also anxious that she would become angry with me 
because I wouldn’t say anything to make her feel better. I knew she would cry a lot but it didn’t 
bother me. Unfortunately, all I was able to do during our meeting was to listen. While she was 
speaking, I was afraid I would break my silence just to tell her everything would be okay. At 
the end of our meeting she said, ‘That was a strange one-way conversation, but it was really 
helpful. Thank you for listening.’ 
Over the week, I was expecting certain things to happen – and they did. First of all, being silent 
didn’t mean my brain would be quiet. The things that used to be on my mind didn’t disappear, 
the voice in my head just got louder. Second of all, my silence didn’t change the way people 
behaved toward me. Although they made comments about my silence, they went on saying 
the same things they used to, making jokes, and sharing their stories. I must also say that I 
expected it to be easy not to speak – and it was, but on Sunday I couldn’t wait to start speaking 
again. You see, I found some benefits to my silence. But it also made me very lonely and I had 
no idea that would happen. 
My week of silence has made me realise how important words are. I decided to speak only 
when I have something important to say.

It feels like yesterday that I was on a plane flying to Canada not knowing what to expect. Now 
I’m back home with (50) _________ memories and I’m writing about my exchange student 
experience.
I wanted to be an exchange student my whole high school life. I thought that living abroad 
(51) _________ be the coolest thing to do. So while I (52) _________ high school in the Czech 
Republic, I applied to an exchange programme agency and waited. Soon I got an e-mail 
that a family in the province of Saskatchewan chose me to stay with them. It took some 
time to (53) _________ all the necessary things before my departure. Finally, (54) _________ 
August 24th 2017, I landed at Regina International Airport to start the adventure of a lifetime.
For the following 10 months, I lived in the city of Yorkton. (55) _________ population is around 
20,000. It was (56) _________ colder there than in my hometown in the Czech Republic, but 
my host family was great: my host mom, Karen, worked as a nurse and took good care of 
the family. She smiled a lot and she was a good (57) _________, too. My host dad, David, was 
an English teacher and we often spent time (58) _________ about the language. He was very 
(59) _________ on learning some basic Czech phrases. Karen and David had twins, Jasper and 
Daisy, (60) _________ were my age. We drove to the same high school every weekday morning 
and after school, I went with Jasper and his team to play baseball. By Christmas, the twins and I 
(61) _________ really good friends.
But throughout the year I experienced some difficulties, too. In winter, I got really homesick1 
and suddenly disliked everything about Canadian culture. I talked about it with (62) _________ 
my own family and my host family, which helped me get over it and enjoy the rest of my stay. 
At the end of my stay, we went on a road trip to Vancouver, British Colombia.
Living alone in a completely different world has (63) _________ me many things. I am now 
open to new ideas, and I believe in myself. I left as a child and I came back as an adult. If I 
(64) _________ a chance to study abroad again, I would definitely go. It’s worth it.
