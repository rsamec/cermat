# 25 Who invented the potato chip?

**Crispy Delight: The Invention of the Potato Chip**
> Eighty years before businessman Herman Lay founded the Lays Company, known today for 
> its potato chips, an incident took place at a resort in Saratoga Springs, New York. A customer 
> complained that the resort’s chef’s French fries were too thick. So, George Crum, the chef, 
> sliced the potatoes paper-thin and deep-fried them until crispy. The result was a revolutionary 
> creation – the first potato chip. At first, it was a regional specialty, but as mass production 
> techniques came in, potato chips became popular everywhere. It was William Tappenden who 
> began producing potato chips commercially. He was using a mechanical slicer invented by Mae 
> Gripp and her husband William. The Gripps’ invention really helped the production of potato 
> chips. Today, millions of bags of potato chips are produced in factories.

# 26 What did David Spargo do according to the article?

**An Australian Band’s Fan**
> David Spargo is a fan of the Australian band *Peking Duk*. After a concert in Melbourne, David 
> went backstage to their dressing room, but a security guard stopped him. David showed him 
> his ID and told him he was a band member’s cousin. To prove it, David opened *Peking Duk’s* 
> Wikipedia webpage on his phone and showed the guard his name there. So the guard let 
> David in. David introduced himself to the band who had no idea who he was. They thought he 
> was another fan using a fake ID to meet them. When David told them that he had added his 
> name to their Wikipedia webpage only a few minutes before, they couldn’t believe it. ‘It was 
> the smartest thing ever. It reminded me of my cousin who also did all kinds of crazy things to 
> meet his favourite artists backstage and made some people angry because of it. But we couldn’t 
> get annoyed with David. He was the first fan to get backstage without a fake ID. And that’s 
> something!’ said a band member.

# 27 What is this piece of news about?

> People travelling to work by public transport daily have been in various situations. Delays and 
> cancellations of services can make their lives harder, and we’re not just talking about heavy rain 
> or icy roads in the winter. Sometimes the situations are rather crazy. For example, last Friday 
> people taking a morning bus to south London saw a large lorry stuck under a railway bridge. It 
> couldn’t move. The situation was funny because the lorry had the slogan ‘WE FIT’ on it. However, 
> the passengers failed to see the funny side of it as they were going to be late for work. The driver 
> of the lorry, which was half a metre taller than the bridge, was half asleep in the rainy morning 
> weather. The company owner apologised at the weekend to road and train travellers for all the 
> delays caused with an amusing statement: ‘WE FIT. Except when we do not. Sorry.’

# 28 Who was borrowed most often from the Human Library in 2021?

**Welcome to the Human Library**

> In Denmark, there is a library where visitors can borrow people instead of books. They meet the 
> people there at a certain time and listen to their life stories for 30 minutes. The goal is to share 
> situations with people that they have not experienced. Visitors can also come to ask for help. The 
> library went online in 2020 and it became especially popular in 2021 due to the difficult times 
> everybody was experiencing during the pandemic. That year, a thousand visitors borrowed 
> someone with financial difficulties. Twice as many visitors came to talk to someone with lots of 
> children. Most of the visitors had only one or two kids but they found it hard anyway. So, these 
> visitors looked for help in the library. Around eight hundred visitors visited the Human Library to 
> talk to unemployed people. This was three hundred visitors more than those who came to talk 
> to someone who was homeless. People with no job were borrowed most often from the Human 
> Library in the previous years, which was a surprising decrease. 
> 
> (*www.humanlibrary.org, inspirováno*)

- [A] people with no job 
- [B] people with no home

# 29 What is Dion Leonard planning to do?

**A Marathon Runner and a Homeless Dog**
> Scottish extreme marathoner, Dion Leonard, was joined by a homeless female dog in China 
> last month while competing in the Gobi March, a 6-day race. She ran with him to the end of 
> the difficult race. In the end, Dion decided to name the dog Gobi after the race, and to bring 
> her home with him. However, taking an animal out of China is not easy, so Dion left Gobi the 
> dog with a friend and went home to start the months-long legal process. But then last week, 
> he learnt that Gobi was missing. Dion flew back to China to look for Gobi himself. And indeed, 
> he found her, and she was in good health! But it will still take some more time to complete the 
> legal process to move Gobi to Scotland. ‘This time I’ll stay in China with Gobi by my side until it is 
> legally okay for her to leave with me. I’ve already spent all of my prize money on my staying here,

# 30 The Museum of Bad Art was founded [^1] in 1994.
[^1]:found: založit
# 31 MOBA was created by two people.  
# 32 MOBA’s first piece of art was a painting of a lady in a green dress.  
# 33 People can visit MOBA for free.  
# 34 Both pieces of art stolen from MOBA were returned.  
# 35 There is more than one security camera in MOBA.  
# 36 Guests at the Bad Cake Café can buy an item on the menu for $1. 
# 37 Both James L. Chung and Evelyn Rojo have visited MOBA twice. 
# 38 James L. Chung’s interview with the owners of MOBA took place sooner than Evelyn Rojo’s interview with them. 
# 39 Both James L. Chung and Evelyn Rojo have offered to give MOBA a piece of bad art. 




> **THE MUSEUM OF BAD ART (MOBA) IN BOSTON**
> 
> Art too bad to be ignored
> 
> **BASIC INFO** → The first exhibition of bad art in MOBA was shown to the world in March 1994, 
> five months after the museum had been founded[^1] in Boston.
> 
> One day antique dealer Scott Wilson discovered a really bad painting in the trash. He liked 
> how bad it was so much that he took it home. He showed it to his friend Jerry Reilly and that 
> was when they created a museum which they called The Museum of Bad Art. They started 
> collecting bad art and later Reilly’s wife Marie helped them prepare the first exhibition for 
> MOBA. 
> 
> **THE EXHIBITION** → Today there are hundreds of pieces of bad art. MOBA’s first piece of art, 
> which Wilson found in the trash, was a portrait of a lady in a field with flowers. Everything 
> except for her hair, chair, and dress is green, so it is a very lively painting. It is still one of the 
> most popular pieces in the museum. 
> 
> **PRACTICAL INFORMATION** → The museum is open Sun/Mon: 11:30 am – 9 pm, Tue – Thu: 
> 11:30 am – 10 pm, and Fri/Sat: 11:30 am – 11 pm. The highest price the museum asks visitors 
> to pay is $6.50, but not as an admission fee, because there is none. The price is for buying a 
> painting if visitors are interested in any. 
> 
> **INTERESTING FACTS** → Although the art has no value, there were two thefts[^2] in the past. In 
>  1996 a painting called *Eileen* disappeared. The museum immediately offered $36.73 for it, but 
> nobody returned it. The second theft happened in 2004, when a painting called *Self Portrait as a Drainpipe* was taken by someone who demanded $10 for its return. However, very soon the 
> painting just appeared back at the museum door without that money being paid. Surprisingly, 
> the same happened with *Eileen* two years later. The thieves were never found.
> 
> After the first theft, museum staff installed a fake security camera inside the museum. But as 
> it did not prevent the other theft no more cameras were added and the one already installed 
> there became a part of the exhibition. 
> 
> **THE BAD CAKE CAFÉ** → The café offers cakes that look just as bad as the paintings. But it is 
> great fun. Guests can decide how much they want to pay for each item on the menu but never 
> less than a dollar. Sometimes people are willing to pay up to $5 for the last ugly, blue muffin. 
> 
> **JOURNALISTS GIVE THEIR VIEWS:**
> 
> **James L. Chung, The Boston Planet:**
> 
> ‘When I visited MOBA for the first time I had so much fun. So, I soon went again with my whole 
> family. That’s when I asked the owners for an interview. They weren’t available until January 
> 2024, but it was worth the wait. The interview took place outside the museum and was fun. 
> They love their museum and are happy that it has so many visitors each year. There are strict 
> rules about what they accept to become a part of the collection. No children’s drawings are 
> accepted for example. I found that out when I offered some of my son’s bad pictures. The 
> owners really don’t want to make fun of the works; they just want to share joy. I definitely 
> recommend that you visit the museum.’
> 
> **Evelyn Rojo, El Arte:**
> ‘You’ll laugh but MOBA was the first museum I visited in the US when I came here in January 
> 2024. And I intend to visit it more than once. Surprisingly, I met the owners there that January 
> day and I asked them for an interview, which took place online six weeks later. As an art lover, 
> I was interested in their reasons for showing bad art. Are they making fun of the artists? No, 
> don’t worry. They just want to show anything can be art if people like it. I offered to give MOBA 
> an excellent, well-known piece of art for the museum to have something nice, but the owners 
> politely refused. I give MOBA five stars!’

> Dear Mum,
> 
> Greetings from training camp in Sweden! The journey to Sweden was long but exciting. The 
> flight from Prague took about two hours. I had a window seat, so I had the chance to enjoy 
> some great views. In Stockholm, I was supposed to hop on a train, but I was late, and the train 
> had already left. There wasn’t another train going in my direction for nearly two hours. So, I 
> waited, got on that one and was lucky my trainer was still waiting to pick me up when I finally 
> arrived at the station near our training camp.  What a patient man! Before he drove me to the 
> hostel the day I arrived, he had taken other athletes from our orienteering club in that same 
> car all the way from Prague. They had to spend eight hours on a ferry to cross the sea from 
> Germany to Sweden. What a cool man! If I had to use a ferry instead of the plane, I wouldn’t go. 
> 
> When I finally got to the training camp hostel, I was tired but also excited to start the training. 
> The hostel is in a forested area, so I was surprised to find there is a big town not far from it. 
> At home, there are usually large forests near villages, not near towns and cities like here. The 
> nearest village is more than thirty miles away. I also thought the hostel would be located near 
> the mountains, but it is flat here. I’m glad because the weather’s really hot and running uphill 
> would make us sweat even more. I miss having water around to cool down in. But thanks to 
> our days spent training near lakes at a far distance from the hostel, there is a chance to have a 
> swim.
> 
> The accommodation is basic but comfortable. I was looking forward to spending time with my 
> friend Julia and sharing a room with her. However, I learned that everybody here must stay on 
> their own as there aren’t rooms for more than one person. Some people appreciate staying in 
> a room with one bed, they say they can relax better that way after training hard. I would still 
> rather share a room with Julia. She was also disappointed when I texted her. She is on her way 
> over here now as she was sick and couldn’t leave for Stockholm with me. I just hope I’m not 
> going to get sick because I hate being alone when I’m not feeling well. 
> 
> The food is tasty here, and we get plenty of it. For breakfast, we typically have bread and 
> cheese or yogurt. I only wish there were eggs, which I love having in the morning and which 
> I never eat at any other time of the day. Lunch and dinner are usually warm meals. We’ve been 
> told that meatballs will be served a few times during our stay. I’m looking forward to trying 
> them here. We had the opportunity to try some fish yesterday and it wasn’t bad, but I’d prefer 
> the meatballs anyway. Desserts are always simple, just pudding or some cookies. So, we’ve 
> decided to bake a pie for ourselves as there are giant blueberries everywhere. There will finally 
> be time for it tomorrow.
> 
> We train hard in the Swedish woods and we learn new techniques. Whenever I make a mistake, 
> my trainer encourages me. And I trust him. We learn how to run fast in these woods full of big 
> stones and it’s much more difficult than I expected. Also, map reading is very different at this 
> training camp compared to what we’re used to, which is an unpleasant surprise. There aren’t 
> many paths here, and all the places look the same. But none of this bothers me. Often, we’re 
> not patient enough and for a moment we regret being here. But improvement needs hard 
> work, right? I know we must always remember the basic skill: quick decision-making. Of course, 
> it can lead to more mistakes, but we mustn’t be afraid to make them. It will only help us not to 
> repeat the same mistakes in the future.

- [A] Hi, I’m Tonda. I live in Prague where I teach 
English literature at a secondary school. I’m 
offering to take you to visit my hometown 
– Hradec Králové. I’ll walk you through the 
historic centre, you’ll love it! I’m offering 
a ride in my car but I’m also willing to go 
by train with you. In fact, it’s even better 
by train because you’ll see the beautiful 
countryside on the way. I’m free on both 
Saturday and Sunday.
- [B] Hey, I’m Dita. I live in Prague now but I come 
from České Budějovice. I’ll take you there. 
You can see historical buildings and other 
places worth seeing. I’m a history student 
at Charles University so you can ask me 
anything about the places we’ll see! I usually 
go on day trips on Saturdays but I’m busy 
next Saturday so I’m only free on Sunday 
this time. Instead of going by train, I’ll drive 
us there and back to Prague.
- [C] Hello, my name’s Marek. I study maths at 
one of Prague’s universities. I’m from Pilsen, 
a beautiful city with both a cathedral and a 
synagogue. I’m offering to take you hiking 
to the woods and hills near Pilsen. We might 
even find some mushrooms! The easiest way 
to get there is by train, which is what we’ll 
do. The journey is great, you might even get 
a quick look at Karlštejn Castle. Both Saturday 
and Sunday are fine by me, so just let me know 
which one works for you and I’ll be ready.
DayTrip©
 *free travelling for free English*
 *conversation lessons*
- [D] Hi, I’m Veronika and I come from Prague 
where I am attending university to become 
a doctor. If you prefer Saturday to Sunday, 
it’s great as it’s the only day I’m free. I’m 
offering to take you either to visit Brno, a city 
in Moravia, which I know very well, or on a 
hike through woods to the Macocha Abyss, 
near Blansko, north of Brno. I used to drive to 
Moravia but it takes a long time now, so we’ll 
go by train. I hope you don’t mind.
- [E] Hey, I’m Petra and I’m from Prague. I love 
going on day trips at the weekend to cities 
and the countryside. I study psychology at 
university and I have a Saturday job so I’m 
available on Sundays only. I’m offering to 
take you on a hiking trip to Říp, a legendary 
Czech hill. It’s near the town of Terezín, 
which we can visit some other time. I’d like 
to go by train, but if you prefer going by car, 
I’ll drive us.
- [F] Hello, my name’s Katka and I live in Mělník 
but I work full time for Charles University 
where I studied English. I teach it now! I 
love going on day trips. Next weekend I’m 
going to visit Karlovy Vary and I’m offering 
to take you with me either on Saturday or 
on Sunday, it doesn’t matter to me. There are 
interesting natural sites in the area of the spa 
town, so I’m offering to take you hiking some 
other time. I dislike trains, so we’ll go by car.
- [G] Hey, I’m Pavel and I live in Prague now. 
I work as a waiter in Café Palais while 
attending university to become a historian. 
I’m offering to take you to go and see Kutná 
Hora next Saturday, or on a hiking trip to 
Bohemian Paradise, a protected landscape 
area. Just let me know which one you prefer.  
We can do the other some day on a Sunday. 
The best way to get to either place is by 
train. However, there will be repairs taking 
place on both railways so we’ll go by car.
